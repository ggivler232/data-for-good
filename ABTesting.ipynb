    "![](./fig/ABTest/fig1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a way to compare multiple versions of a feature to see which performs better. It is typically used for websites\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: If the advertisement is bigger, will more people click on it? Are users more likely to purchase from a website with a different user interface?\n",
    "\n",
    "Example Application: Google doing A/B Testing with different shades of blue for link colors\n",
    "https://bharathbalasubramanian.medium.com/data-driven-decisions-googles-50-shades-of-blue-experiment-996f01819a97 \n",
    "\n",
    "Another Example Application: Harvard Business School: “Is A/B Testing Effective? Evidence from 35,000 Startups”\n",
    "https://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/is-ab-testing-effective-evidence-from-35000-startups \n",
    "\n",
    "It is the most basic type of a randomized controlled experiment. It is a statistical test and the number of samples (n) needed to determine statistical significance should be determined before the experiment is done. A null and alternative hypothesis must be determined then a statistical test needs to be performed to determine whether the results between the two groups are statistically significant.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./fig/ABTest/fig2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "An A/B test can be tied to multi-armed bandits because the algorithm will use the differences between the two responses to determine if an option should be exploited or explored.\n",
    "\n",
    "With A/B testing of a graphic e-commerce website advertisement (like our python tutorial) exploitation would mean using the advertisement that is more likely to be clicked on as the “winner” and using this advertisement to drive clicks to the companies’ website. Exploration could mean getting more data on the advertisement that seems “least effective”. For example, continuing user testing to see if the less popular advertisement is more effective with certain user demographics compared to the “winner”. \n"
